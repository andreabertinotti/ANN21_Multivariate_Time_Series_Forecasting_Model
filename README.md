# ANN21_Multivariate_Time_Series_Forecasting_Model

This is the model I developed for a university project in the course of Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning. 
Given a training set, the goal was to design and implement forecasting models able to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequence to correctly predict the future. 
The time series in training set was composed of 68528 samples, with 7 different features.
The metric used for the evaluation is the is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and this model achieved a RMSE of 4.4.
